# algos-typescript
I rewrote some algorithms to manipulate strings, as a brain game and to get familiar with typescript.

* strings:
* anagrams: detect if two strings are anagram of each other (example: bazar and razba)
* permutations: print all permutations a string can have
..* (example: permutation("abc") will print abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba). it uses recursion
* hasDoublons: detect in an optimized way if a string has doublons (example: vivien has doublons, bruno has not)
* removeDuplicates: remove duplicate character. Challenge: I couldn't use an extra buffer to resolve this

# how to run:
npm install -g gulp
gulp
